This document provides a high-level overview of the application's architecture.

Monolith vs. Microservices:
-----------------------------

For now, AMS will be a monolith application written in FastAPI.

The application is deployed on AWS and uses the following AWS services:
- one domain on Route53 (agenticmindscape-qa.com)
- one Lambda (ams-auth-service)
- one API Gateway (ams-primary-api-gateway)
- one S3 bucket (ams-static-assets-bucket-qa)
- one CloudFront configuration

The API application that serves up:
  -> HTMX for the HTML partials (including Vue based componenets)
  -> JSON for the Vue based components

The static front-end pages will reside on S3.

AWS CloudFront will be used to route the request to either:
  -> S3 for all requests that don't have /services/ in the URL path 
  -> API Gateway for all requests that have /services/ in the URL path 

For now there is a single Lambda for the AMS application (i.e. a monolith), but will 
later be split into multiple Lambdas (one per service), and the API Gateway 
will be configured for the appropriate Lambda to be called based on the URL path: /services/[service name]
