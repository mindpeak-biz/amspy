INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPLOYING A FASTAPI APP TO AWS LAMBDA
======================================================

You can deploy the app as a zip Lambda, or as a Docker container.

You can either deploy the FastAPI project without the Python packages included in the zip file, 
or just the app in the zip file as long as the Python packages that are the dependencies are in a Lambda layer that you Lambda has access to.

These instructions are for deploying a zip Lambda that contains the package dependencies within it, 
along with the FastAPI application.
